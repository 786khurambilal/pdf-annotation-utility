# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing PDF reader by automatically detecting QR codes within uploaded PDF pages and creating call-to-action links based on the QR code content. When a PDF is uploaded, the system will scan each page for QR codes, decode their content, and automatically generate clickable call-to-action elements that combine the QR code data with contextual page information like headings.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a reader, I want the system to automatically detect QR codes in my uploaded PDFs, so that I don't have to manually scan them with my phone.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PDF is uploaded THEN the system SHALL automatically scan each page for QR codes
2. WHEN a QR code is detected on a page THEN the system SHALL decode the QR code content
3. WHEN QR code scanning fails THEN the system SHALL continue processing without interrupting the PDF display
4. WHEN multiple QR codes exist on a single page THEN the system SHALL detect and process all of them
5. WHEN a page contains no QR codes THEN the system SHALL continue to the next page without error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a reader, I want automatically detected QR codes to be converted into call-to-action links, so that I can easily access the linked content while reading.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a QR code is successfully decoded THEN the system SHALL create a call-to-action link using the decoded content
2. WHEN creating an auto-generated CTA THEN the system SHALL use "http://test.com/" as the base URL
3. WHEN creating an auto-generated CTA THEN the system SHALL append the decoded QR code value to the base URL
4. WHEN a QR code contains a URL THEN the system SHALL use the complete URL from the QR code as the CTA link
5. WHEN a QR code contains non-URL text THEN the system SHALL append it as a parameter to "http://test.com/"

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a reader, I want auto-generated call-to-actions to have meaningful titles based on page content, so that I can understand what each link represents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating an auto-generated CTA THEN the system SHALL attempt to extract the page heading as the CTA title
2. WHEN a page heading is found THEN the system SHALL use it as the CTA title
3. WHEN no clear heading is found THEN the system SHALL use "QR Code Link - Page [number]" as the default title
4. WHEN multiple headings exist on a page THEN the system SHALL use the first or most prominent heading
5. WHEN the heading text is too long THEN the system SHALL truncate it to a reasonable length (50 characters max)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a reader, I want auto-generated call-to-actions to be visually distinguishable from manual ones, so that I can identify their source.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying auto-generated CTAs THEN the system SHALL mark them with a distinctive visual indicator
2. WHEN showing CTA lists THEN the system SHALL group or label auto-generated CTAs separately
3. WHEN a user hovers over an auto-generated CTA THEN the system SHALL display a tooltip indicating it was auto-created from a QR code
4. WHEN managing CTAs THEN the system SHALL allow users to identify which ones were auto-generated
5. WHEN displaying auto-generated CTAs THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling that differentiates them from manual CTAs

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a reader, I want to be able to manage auto-generated call-to-actions, so that I can edit or remove them if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auto-generated CTAs are created THEN the system SHALL allow users to edit their titles and URLs
2. WHEN a user edits an auto-generated CTA THEN the system SHALL remove its auto-generated status
3. WHEN a user wants to delete an auto-generated CTA THEN the system SHALL provide the same deletion options as manual CTAs
4. WHEN a user disables auto-generation THEN the system SHALL not create new auto-generated CTAs but preserve existing ones
5. WHEN re-uploading the same PDF THEN the system SHALL not duplicate existing auto-generated CTAs

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a reader, I want QR code scanning to work efficiently without significantly slowing down PDF loading, so that my reading experience remains smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning for QR codes THEN the system SHALL process pages in the background without blocking PDF display
2. WHEN QR code scanning is in progress THEN the system SHALL show a subtle progress indicator
3. WHEN QR code scanning completes THEN the system SHALL notify the user of any auto-generated CTAs found
4. WHEN scanning large PDFs THEN the system SHALL prioritize visible pages first
5. WHEN QR code processing fails THEN the system SHALL log errors without affecting the main PDF functionality

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want auto-generated call-to-actions to integrate seamlessly with the existing annotation system, so that they work consistently with other features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auto-generated CTAs are created THEN the system SHALL store them using the same data structure as manual CTAs
2. WHEN displaying annotation lists THEN the system SHALL include auto-generated CTAs alongside other annotations
3. WHEN exporting or backing up annotations THEN the system SHALL include auto-generated CTAs with appropriate metadata
4. WHEN a user has multiple documents THEN the system SHALL associate auto-generated CTAs with the correct document and user
5. WHEN switching between documents THEN the system SHALL load the appropriate auto-generated CTAs for each document

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want control over the QR code auto-detection feature, so that I can enable or disable it based on my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the application THEN the system SHALL provide a setting to enable or disable QR code auto-detection
2. WHEN QR code auto-detection is disabled THEN the system SHALL not scan for QR codes in new uploads
3. WHEN a user enables QR code detection THEN the system SHALL offer to scan existing PDFs for QR codes
4. WHEN QR code detection settings change THEN the system SHALL save the preference for future sessions
5. WHEN QR code detection is enabled by default THEN the system SHALL inform users about the feature and how to control it
