# QR Scanning Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Canvas Element Not Found
**Problem**: QR scanner couldn't locate page canvas elements
**Solution**: Enhanced canvas detection with multiple fallback strategies:
- Primary: `[data-page-number="${pageNumber}"]`
- Fallback 1: `.react-pdf__Page[data-page-number="${pageNumber}"]`
- Fallback 2: Find by page index in `.react-pdf__Page` elements
- Fallback 3: Look in parent/sibling elements

### 2. Image Data Extraction Failures
**Problem**: `getImageData()` failing with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'height')"
**Solution**: Added comprehensive validation:
- Validate canvas dimensions before extraction
- Validate 2D context availability
- Validate image data structure and length
- Added defensive parameter copying for jsQR

### 3. Timeout Issues
**Problem**: Pages timing out during 5-second scan limit
**Solution**: Improved timing and reliability:
- Increased page timeout from 5s to 10s
- Increased canvas search attempts from 10 to 15
- Increased delay between attempts from 100ms to 200ms
- Added 500ms delay between page scans
- Increased auto-start delay from 2s to 5s

### 4. Error Handling Improvements
**Problem**: Poor error recovery and excessive retries
**Solution**: Enhanced error handling:
- Reduced max retries from 3 to 2
- More lenient error handling (continue unless critical)
- Better distinction between retryable and critical errors
- Only stop on consecutive failures (3 in a row)
- More frequent memory cleanup (every 5 pages vs 10)

### 5. Canvas Content Validation
**Problem**: Blank canvases causing processing failures
**Solution**: Added content validation:
- Check if canvas has actual rendered content
- Warn about blank canvases but continue processing
- Better logging for debugging canvas issues

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Load a PDF with QR codes** and verify scanning works without errors
2. **Check browser console** for improved error messages and debugging info
3. **Test with different PDF sizes** to ensure memory management works
4. **Try scanning immediately after PDF load** to test timing improvements
5. **Test with PDFs that have no QR codes** to ensure graceful handling

## Configuration Changes

- Page timeout: 5s → 10s
- Max retries: 3 → 2
- Canvas search attempts: 10 → 15
- Search delay: 100ms → 200ms
- Auto-start delay: 2s → 5s
- Memory cleanup frequency: every 10 pages → every 5 pages
- Inter-page delay: 0ms → 500ms

These changes should significantly improve QR scanning reliability and reduce the timeout and canvas detection errors you were experiencing.
