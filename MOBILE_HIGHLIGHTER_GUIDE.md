## Visual Indicators (Development Mode)

When running in development mode, you'll see debug indicators:

- **Purple "HIGHLIGHT: SHOWING"** badge: Confirms highlighter is open
- **Console logs**: Check browser console for detailed selection info

## Troubleshooting

### **Problem**: Text selection doesn't work
**Solutions**:
1. Make sure you're pressing and holding (not just tapping)
2. Try selecting text in the middle of a paragraph (not at edges)
3. Ensure the PDF has loaded completely
4. Check that you're not accidentally triggering zoom gestures

### **Problem**: Highlighter modal doesn't appear
**Solutions**:
1. Check console logs for text selection events
2. Make sure you've selected actual text (not empty space)
3. Try selecting a longer piece of text (at least a few words)
4. Ensure you're not in the middle of a zoom or scroll gesture

### **Problem**: Double-tap zooms instead of selecting
**Solutions**:
1. Use press-and-hold method instead
2. Wait a moment between taps if double-tapping
3. Try selecting text that's already visible without zooming

## Mobile-Specific Tips

### **iOS Safari**:
- Use a firm press-and-hold gesture
- The text selection handles should appear
- Drag the handles to adjust selection

### **Android Chrome**:
- Press and hold until selection starts
- Use the selection handles to fine-tune
- The highlighter should appear automatically

### **Mobile Firefox**:
- Similar to Chrome, press and hold
- May need slightly longer hold time
- Selection highlight should be visible

## Alternative Methods

### **Using the Sidebar**:
1. Tap the "üìã" or "Show Annotations" button to open sidebar
2. Navigate to the "Highlights" tab
3. This shows existing highlights but doesn't create new ones

### **Desktop Mode Fallback**:
If mobile highlighting isn't working:
1. Switch to desktop view temporarily
2. Create highlights using mouse selection
3. Switch back to mobile view to see the highlights
